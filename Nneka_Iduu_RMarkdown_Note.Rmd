## See notes below;

#### This is a note that covers rmarkdown basics including;create R markdown documents, basic syntax for R markdown and how to include plots and pictures.

# Conceptual understanding

## RMarkdown uses knitr, rmarkdown and pandoc
## Creating documents with R Markdown starts with an .Rmd file that contains a combination of markdown (content with simple text formatting) and R code chunks. The .Rmd file is fed to knitr, which executes all of the R code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the R code and its output.

## The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating a finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, handout, book, dashboard, package vignette or other format.

### In summary; Rmarkdown => markdown => document

#Learning Objectives

## yaml headers
## concept of knitting
## where to write R code
## including a picture
## code chunk options
## style in R markdown

## To start; We install TinyTex inorder to have LaTex to help reder pdf documents
#install.packages('tinytex')
#tinytex::install_tinytex()

#1.YAML headers and the initial creation of an R markdown document

## To start, we need to know how to open an R markdown document, open the add New File button(upper left) and click the R Markdown
## Save with name and a default yaml section will appear with your title, name, date and the document type(default html)
#---
#title: "RMarkdownNote1"
#author: "Nneka Iduu"
#date: "2025-02-27"
#output: html_document

### We can change the yaml header to output into an html document and into other outputs like word file, pdfs
### and knit them by click the knot button and choosing the file type
#title: "RMarkdownNote1"
#author: "Nneka Iduu"
#date: "2025-02-27"
#output:
  #html_document:
  #word_document:
  #pdf_document:

### We can also include generate table of content with toc in the header of the document or Makes the table of contents float alongside the text for easy navigation using toc_float
#output: 
#html_document:
  #toc: true
#toc_float: true
#word_document:
 #pdf_document:

### We can also change output to github markdown files or .md files which we can commit and push to github
#title: "RMarkdownNote1"
#author: "Nneka Iduu"
#date: "2025-02-27"
#output:
  #md_document:
    #variant: gfm
  #html_document:
  #word_document:
  #pdf_document:
  
#2. Inserting code chunks

### We can insert code chunks by selecting the insert code chunk button on the upper right and selecting R
### In the chunk we can include comments and R codes like we do in the normal R script
## This is an example of R code, the click on the play button in the chunk
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#This is an R code
summary(mtcars)
```
##This is how to include figures

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg))+
  geom_point()


```
## Note When we see an empty chunk, we can control the output using different parameter like;
#{r chunk_name, ...}

#Global parameters
#```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#```
#or set up include=TRUE
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(markdown)

```


#3. R Markdown formatting options

## Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs using;
# First-level header
# For italics, you need asterisks  or underscore beginning and end of the word or sentence
*This is a test of italics*
_This is a test of italics_

## Second-level header
## We can also list. Unordered list items start with *, -, or +
1. one subitem
2. two subitems
  - one unordered item
  
##For bold;
**This is a test of bold**

## To include images
![shrek and ggplot](IMG_8889-Copy.jpg)

## 4. To inclulde links

### Third-level header

# 5. Formatting Tables

### We use knitr with kable
```{r}
kable(head(mtcars, n = 5), digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```


### 6. Default note on new R Markdown document

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
